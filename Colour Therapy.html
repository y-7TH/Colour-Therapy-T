	Flowers, whether in a bouquet or growing in a pot or flower bed, always have a special way of lifting our spirits. This is due
in part to the principles of color therapy, an alternative therapy grounded in the idea that colors have powerful
effects on our moods. You can combine the wellness benefits of gardening with some color therapy, to get the best
of both worlds! Add a few of these colorful flowers to your Des Moines garden to make you, and your neighbors,
smile.</p>

    <td><p style="font-family: courier; text-indent: 45px">According to the principles of color therapy, certain colors tend to specific emotional responses in people. Blues
are calming, greens are tranquil and grounding, yellows are cheerful, red is passionate and romantic, pink promotes
kindess and gentleness, and purple inspires creativity and mystery.</p>
